## Glaggle game
made with the [Ooga Booga Game Engine](https://github.com/alpinestudios/oogabooga)

Story is that you're a dwarf trying to go as deep as possible, so you have to build stairs downwards to reach new "biomes" with different ores and maybe enemies later on. After mining a sufficient amount, you go back up to the surface to smelt ores at the smelter guy and sell gems at the jeweller, then buy food, upgrade your gear with the ores you smelted and go back to work.
